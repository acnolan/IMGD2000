INTERCEPTED LETTER
content:
Gerard,

Thank you so much for all the
help you have given me already!
Everything is about finished, although I do need some help with one last detail. Do you have any information regarding where I may discover how to create a bomb? Deborah is going to come across one, and I must have the details correct. I have investigated my local library, to no success.

Once that is in place, I need only send my work to an agent, and once I find one who is willing to help me, hopefully the rest will work itself out. Sorry to impose, but please do reply if you have any knowledge about the bombs! If not, I'll ask around, but I've kept this under wraps in case it doesn't work out, and I don't want them to get concerned about my inquiries.
s
Sincerely,
Charlene
