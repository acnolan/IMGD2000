INTERCEPTED LETTER

April 1 

Dad:

Mom won't let me write in code anymore. She's no fun. But yesterday I found a cockroach on the porch! Mom screamed when she saw it, but now I have it in a jar in my room. She's doing fine, since you asked. John is gone, and now Mom is seeing some guy named Ernst. I don't like him. He said my bugs were "unsanitary". Can you pleeease visit soon?

--Mikie
