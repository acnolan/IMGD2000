SIELAND:
		Sylvia, it's me--
		
FEMALE:
		What do you want, Georg?
		
SIELAND:
		I wanted to see how you were
		doing.
		
FEMALE:
		Georg, it has been two years!
		You need to stop calling me.
		Find a girlfriend. Surely one
		of those actresses you work
		with find you passably
		handsome.
		
SIELAND:
		Have you seen my latest film?
		
FEMALE:
		...Yes. I went to the
		theater with John and Mikie.
		
SIELAND:
		What did you think?
		
FEMALE:
		It reeked of Communism and
		thoroughly reminded me of
		why we are no longer
		together. Now, unless you
		had something actually
		important to tell me,
		I have errands to run.
