FEMALE:
		Georg.

SIELAND:
		I thought you didn't want
		to talk to me anymore.

FEMALE:
		You've been going behind
		my back to talk to Mikie.
	
SIELAND:
		I sent him letters in
		the post. I assumed you
		noticed.
		
FEMALE:
		Mikie told me it was from
		a school friend! Now he
		won't stop asking me when
		you might visit. What
		thoughts have you been
		putting in his head?
		
SIELAND:
		It isn't fair to our son that
		you prevent him from seeing
		me when he clearly wants to!

FEMALE:
		Mikie is better off as far
		from you as possible.
		
SIELAND:
		Please let me visit. I won't
		talk about politics. He
		wants to show me
		his bug collection.
		
FEMALE:
		Ugh, that horrid thing...
		I suppose your
		correspondence has been
		why he maintains that
		bad habit as well?
		
SIELAND:
		I won't talk politics.
		
FEMALE:
		...I'll give you one chance, and
		I'll be keeping a close ear on
		you the entire time. This is
		only to make Mikie happy,
		you understand.
