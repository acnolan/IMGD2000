FIELD REPORT
content:
A field agent was trailing
Mr.Pearson, looking for
any signs of suspicious
behavior. Mr.Pearson began
at his workplace, then drove
in a winding path that
often doubled-back on itself.
At several points, the agent
had to run red lights to keep
Mr.Pearson in sight. Eventually,
Mr.Pearson parked at a hospital
and went inside.
