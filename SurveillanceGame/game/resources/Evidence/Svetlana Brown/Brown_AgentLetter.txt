INTERCEPTED LETTER

Ted:

I understand your concern, being my agent, but you can't deny that Georg's movies are popular. If he offers another role, I want to see it. My reputation is my concern. Just because people are using Georg and Communist in the same sentence behind closed doors doesn't mean anything to me.
