BROWN:
		Hello, is Georg available?
				
SIELAND:
		Svetlana! What do you
		need?
		
BROWN:
		I was wondering if you
		had any new plans in
		the works with a role
		for me.
		
SIELAND:
		Really? I wouldn't
		think you would be
		interested given the
		backlash from that
		last film.
		
BROWN:
		Backlash means it
		was popular enough to
		be noticed, right?
