INTERCEPTED LETTER
content:
Dear Cedric,

I'm glad to hear Mother is on the mend. I've sent along a box of her favorite chocolates along with the usual package. I wasn't sure about the policies regarding sending edibles in foreign packages, but I hid them among the other things and no one at the post office seemed to notice.

I'm a bit worried that Georg's reputation is rubbing off on me. I'm almost certain I heard someone mutter "Communist" under their breath as I passed them. But who am I to complain, when that movie he directed is so popular?

Send along my love to Mother! I would appreciate it if you kept the Communist slander to yourself, though.

Love,
Svetlana
