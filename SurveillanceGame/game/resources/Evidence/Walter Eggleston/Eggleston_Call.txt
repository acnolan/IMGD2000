EGGLESTON:
		Hi, Anne, this is Walter.
		
FEMALE:
		Walter, hi! It's been
		months! How have you
		been holding up?

EGGLESTON:
		As well as can be expected.
		Pretty average.
		
FEMALE:
		You sound pretty excited
		about something.
		What's up?
		
EGGLESTON:
		I was organizing
		some of my stuff
		and found all those
		records you lent me
		last year.
		
FEMALE:
		Really? I was
		wondering when you'd
		admit that you lost them.
		
EGGLESTON:
		Well, now I found them!
		Want to meet up and 
		I'll get them back
		to you?
		
FEMALE:
		That sounds great!
		Sometime next week?
		
EGGLESTON:
		I'm pretty busy
		next week, how
		about the week after?
		
FEMALE:
		Sounds good!
