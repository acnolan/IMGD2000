Welcome to the team!

This is your Supervisor, Charles O'Brien, and I'll be helping you get acclimated to your new job as a surveillance analyst in Branch 3A. Each day, I'll be sending along information our team has collected on various citizens. 

You can review information by looking in the folder on your desk. When information looks important, store it in the filing cabinet. You can view information later to cross-reference for suspicious activity by looking under that citizen's files in the filing cabinet. There's also a notepad on the desk for you to track your thoughts.

Your day ends at five. Once you have no evidence left to review, you're free to leave through the door. 

There was a robbery at the federal mint yesterday, so look for suspicious citizens and store all the information. What we know so far is that the burglar was wearing a Wilson Clyde Cyber-Ducks jersey.

If you forget anything from this memo, you can reference it again from the binder. Good luck!
