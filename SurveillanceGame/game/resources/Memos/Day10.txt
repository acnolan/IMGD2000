You've made this branch proud and proven yourself to be competent and trustworthy with the detainment of that Soviet spy!

I've compiled a list of the heads of the branches for the department, and included myself to reduce suspicion. I'm sure that one of the heads is spying on our branch...find out who has been acting the most suspiciously and report them. Pursuing their own agendas at the expense of MY branch... I won't allow it! One of them could be a Communist.

I know what you're probably thinking, but think of your family. What would they do if you didn't have this job?
