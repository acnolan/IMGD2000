Unfortunately, I may not be able to pass along much information tomorrow. My daughter is ill, so I'm coming to work late to take better care of her. Continue to look into any information you do get and make detainments!

I'm certain there are more criminals and enemy sympathizers lurking out there. Weed them out--keep our country safe and our branch's reputation sterling!
