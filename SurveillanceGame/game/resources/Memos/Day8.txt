My daughter is feeling much better! I am now back to my full work commitment, and have been able to give more thought to why our branch is not outperforming the other branches as much as usual.

I wonder if something suspicious is happening here in the surveillance department. We all have experience observing the public... who is to say it isn't happening in our own office? I'm going to look into it.

You act natural and continue your duties.
