I sent you information on Candace Green, yes? Well, another branch has given the order to bring her in. Turns out she was that spy I warned you about. With this, Branch 3A's reputation is doomed. This was an important assignment, and you failed me. I have no choice but to let you go. Maybe you'll have better luck delivering mail.
