Thank you.

King must have been the one. Her branch was performing well.

I have to offer you my sincerest thanks. Now our branch can continue to enforce justice within the country without dealing with as much competition from within.

Did I say competition? I meant corruption. I ran out of correction fluid for my typewriter. Sorry about that.

Anyway, you deserve a few days off, to reflect on all you have accomplished, and so early in your career. Be proud!
