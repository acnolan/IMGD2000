McDowell?

I admit I'm a bit surprised, but you were the one who had the time to look over the evidence, not me. I never did like him. His branch is too lenient. 

With McDowell out of the way, I'll see if I can find more Communists lurking in the general populace. I'll pass them along to you, and I'm sure you will arrest them with all speed!

You deserve a few days off, to reflect on all you have accomplished so early in your career.
