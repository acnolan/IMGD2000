You have recently reported your own supervisor, Charles O'Brien. The report shows he was using the surveillance for his own purposes, with so many requests for information about his ex-wife and those rumored Communists he talks about so much. McDowell and I had noticed his fondness for detaining purported Communists, but thought nothing of it.

We commend you for your efforts. However, now Branch 3A has no supervisor, so we are going to have to let you and the other analysts go until we replace O'Brien.
