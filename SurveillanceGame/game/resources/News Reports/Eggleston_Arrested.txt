The federal authorities have arrested a Walter Eggleston on suspicion of criminal intent. He has been described by friends and family as a fun-loving and carefree person. His relations told us they were greatly distressed by his arrest.

"If they're arresting our innocent son without any hard evidence, how are any of us supposed to sleep at night?" his mother said.

The federal authorities have declined to reveal the information they used to determine his intent, or where they came across such information.
