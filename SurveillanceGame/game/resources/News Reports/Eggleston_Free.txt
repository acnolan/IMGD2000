Everyone is left in states of grief and shock as the Department of Motor Vehicles was attacked. Shots were fired from within the building, leaving dozens dead and many more hospitalized. As one of the survivors said when asked for comment, "it's frightening, and I only wish that there had been some way to know that this was happening, and that it could have been prevented." The criminal responsible was identified to be Walter Eggleston, a man described as fun-loving and carefree. He has been taken in by local authorities and is being held without bail.
