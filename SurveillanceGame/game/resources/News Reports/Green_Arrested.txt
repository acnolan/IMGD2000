A professional golfer has been arrested on charges of suspicious activity and Soviet collusion. Candace Green recently played in the Golf Putter National tournament, placing second to last. Friends of the golfer claimed that lately she seemed absent-minded and less focused on her golfing career, but declined to tell them why.

The federal authorities have declined to comment on where they obtained their information for the arrest.
