A local college student, Terrence Ianson, has been arrested on charges of suspicious intent by the federal authorities. Friends and family expressed shock and outrage at his arrest.

"He's been nothing but a hard worker and a bundle of fun," Claudia Ianson, Ianson's sister, fumed to our journalists. "I don't understand what 'proof' there is against him!"

The federal authorities have declined to comment on where they came across their incriminating evidence, or even what this evidence is. Protests are expected to be held at Ianson's college regarding his arrest.
