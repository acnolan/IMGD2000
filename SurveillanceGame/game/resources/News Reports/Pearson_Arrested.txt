Locals are left in shock as the affectionately
nicknamed "paranoid Pearson" was taken in by federal
authorities yesterday.

His wife is currently in the hospital for heart complications and was unavailable for comment, but Pearson's sister-in-law provides us with an image of his personality: "He always insisted on using pay phones and taking overly long routes to prevent 'them' from keeping tabs on him. Maybe his antics only drew their attention, instead of preventing it."

The FBI declined to comment on his detainment, or how they came across the information used in making the arrest.
