Renowned film director Georg Sieland, who has directed movies such as "Dancing with Daisies" and his most recent work, "Coal", has been arrested by federal agents on charges of Soviet collusion.

His recent films have been argued by critics to contain sympathetic views to Communism. Critics and fans alike are split in their beliefs of Sieland's alleged spying. The FBI declined to comment on his detainment.
