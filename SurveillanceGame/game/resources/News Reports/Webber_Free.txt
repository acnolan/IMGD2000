A new novel has been taking the literary world by storm! "Danger at the Drama", a mystery thriller by debut author Charlene Webber, tells a gripping tale of danger, deceit, and explosions. "Getting the information about the bombs was the most difficult part," Webber told one journalist. "There was no easy way to find exact information, but I wanted to be as accurate as possible. I'm only surprised no one found me more suspicious!"
