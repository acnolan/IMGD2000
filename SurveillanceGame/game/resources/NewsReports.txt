	A new novel has been taking the literary world by storm!
	"Danger at the Drama", a mystery thriller by debut author
	Charlene Webber, tells a gripping tale of danger, deceit,
	and explosions. "Getting the information about the bombs
	was the most difficult part," Webber told one journalist.
	"There was no easy way to find exact information, but
	I wanted to be as accurate as possible. I'm only surprised
	no one found me more suspicious!"

	<None>

Arrested:
	Locals are left in shock as the affectionately
	nicknamed "paranoid Pearson" was taken in by federal
	authorities yesterday. His wife is currently in the
	hospital for heart complications and was unavailable for comment,
	but Pearson's sister-in-law provides us with an image of his personality:
	"He always insisted on using pay phones and taking overly long routes
	to prevent 'them' from keeping tabs on him. Maybe his antics only drew
	their attention, instead of preventing it." The FBI declined to comment
	on his detainment, or how they came across the information used in
	making the arrest.
